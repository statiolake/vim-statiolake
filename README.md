# vim-statiolake

This is my private Vim package for Windows, heavily inspired by vim-kt
<https://github.com/k-takata/vim-kt>.

## Differences from the official package

- My private patches applied
    - Apply patches in statiolake/vim on top of vim/vim
- Enable following interfaces:
    - LuaJIT 2.1 (included)
    - Python 3.9
